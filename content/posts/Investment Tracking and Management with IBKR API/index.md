title: Investment Tracking and Management with IBKR API
---
## Abstract

The idea is to create a script with streamlined order placement, management, portfolio performance tracking and organized data for technical analysis. This will be combined with my consolidated CSV files from Rocket Money to provide projections for investment rate and savings rate and spending information to create the ultimate finance tool.

## Features

Rocket Money CSV Files for Spending Information
Identity Theft Monitoring ?? Plaid API?
Portfolio Tracking and Analysis
Projections on Saving, Retirement, and Investments

Place and Manage Trade Orders through the IBKR API


## Getting the IBKR API up and running

To get the API up and running you will need to install either Trader Workstation (TWS) or IB Gateway.

I have chosen to use the TWS API with a Python Client, since it is my most familiar language.

I followed the Instructions at: https://www.interactivebrokers.com/campus/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-doc/ to properly configure TWS and the API

After getting my paper trading account linked to practice with real data in a simulated environment
